This proposal adds SIMD types and operations to Javascript, focusing on the value semantics. The proposal adds new primitive types float32x4, etc, together with wrappers and a definition of their behavior in the language. The proposal discusses float32x4 and just a couple functions on it, with the idea that it would extend similarly to other SIMD types. Rough definitions for more types and functions that operate on them can be found at <a href="https://github.com/johnmccutchan/ecmascript_simd/blob/master/tc39/simd-spec262.md">the SIMD.js spec</a>. This document is organized in terms of where changes would be made to the ES6 spec.

<p>
The key problem that this spec aims to solve, over the previous informal SIMD specification, is the way that SIMD values were previously objects with identity-based equality. Maintaining object identity puts a big burden on compilers to maintain this identity through operations, where they would rather be able to duplicate and de-duplicate SIMD values arbitrarily based on algebraic identities. By making SIMD values into primitive types with structural equality, compilers are given more freedom. However, this gives a lot to expand on in the spec.
</p>

<p>
Ideally, SIMD values will fit into a larger value types proposal. Such a proposal would be a bit more involved, but good work has already been done in that direction. This document describes SIMD without a larger value type system, but it aims to be consistent with how value types might work, and once someone steps forward to describe value types in more detail, it will be great to simplify this text by just explaining SIMD in terms of value types.
